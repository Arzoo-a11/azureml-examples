# Quickstarts for Compute Instance

description: Quickstart Notebooks

The notebooks in this tutorial will be used as getting started examples on the Notebooks landing page in AML Studio, and will run in a Compute Instance.

The tutorial consists of three notebooks:

- [AzureMLin10mins.ipynb](AzureMLin10mins.ipynb)
- [ClassificationWithAutomatedML.ipynb](ClassificationWithAutomatedML.ipynb)
- [GettingStartedWithPythonSDK.ipynb](GettingStartedWithPythonSDK.ipynb)

**AzureML in 10mins** 

This notebook takes the user through a data ingest, training and deployment workflow that can be completed in 10minutes. This notebook does *not* use job submission, but rather an interactive run to reduce the number of concepts. 

**Getting started with AzureML Job Submission** 

This notebook takes the user through the salient AzureML concepts in order to submit jobs â€“ ScriptRunConfig, Environments, Datasets, logging. 

**Classification with Automated ML** 

This notebook shows how to run an Automated ML experiment.
